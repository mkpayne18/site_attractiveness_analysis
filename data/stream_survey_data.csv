Only a handful of samples came from live fish. Pinks were almost all pre-spawn and they were in copious amounts. Worked steadily upstream until it became too overgrown and braided for us to continue. Also, it was a bear safety concern. The weather was overcast and intermittantly raining through the day. The water had good visibility with a normal flow.

IMPORTANT NOTE: a small mix-up of otoliths occured during QA process and was noticed during 48 hour QA, therefore the survey was edited and retransmitted after another QA. As you will see in comments for individual samples, cell 16 has two missing otoliths and cell 18 has 4 otoliths in it. We believe that two of the otoliths in cell 18 belong to cell 16, but we cannot be sure, therefore these two samples have been labeled as 'uncertain pairing'. Since 17 is between the two, this has also been labeled as 'uncertain pairing'. We feel fairly confident that the other 27 samples in this tray are OK. Survey began at low tide today.
